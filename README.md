# Text_Emotions_Detection_DataScience_ML_Project:
A human can express his emotions in any form, such as face, gestures, speech and text. The detection of text emotions is a content-based classification problem. In this notebook, I will explore the problem of text emotions detection with machine learning using Python.In machine learning, the detection of textual emotions is the problem of content-based classification, which is the task of natural language processing. Detecting a personâ€™s emotions is a difficult task, but detecting the emotions using text written by a person is even more difficult as a human can express his emotions in any form.Usually, emotions are expressed as joy, sadness, anger, surprise, hate, fear, etc. Recognizing this type of emotion from a text written by a person plays an important role in applications such as chatbots, customer support forum, customer reviews etc.
